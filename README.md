## Description : In the scenario where you have a S3 bucket with a large amount of contents and want to delete it via an EC2 instance. This script creates the EC2 instance and then deletes the contents. And once complete, it terminates itself.

## Note: There are other ways to do this task. This is just the way I solved the issue. And wanted to share the script.
